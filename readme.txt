Sorry, there is no option in this version for specify a language. The language is set based on which language your Wordpress Installation uses. The plugin has English, Norwegian. If you would like another language, contact me and I can try to add it for you.

Ex. If your Wordpress is using English language the plugin will load the English language file. If your Wordpress is using Norwegian language the plugin will load the Norwegian language file. If your Wordpress is using a language that not has representet by its own language file, it will choose English as standard.
